My List for December 16, 19XX

Deliver the "Big Box" to Chief Haskell. (An old codger, war veteran, always makes a scene. Town a lot safer and livelier while he is here.)

Check Jenna's porch for her usual package. (Maybe ask her about ordering some honey for yourself.)

Check in with Boss Matt for additional orders. (He gets his own office at the Post Office, a decorative sort to be sure.)

Take it easy! (No use breaking your knee for this job. Again.)
