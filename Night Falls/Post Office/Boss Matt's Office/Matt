Y-you're back already?

*sigh*

Normally I would have a bunch of letters and boxes for you,
but we are both understaffed and have little to do.

If you can, can you go check on Mr. Holland?

H-he was supposed to come in today, but hasn't called in and is
not picking up the phone.

Just go to his apartment at Apple Creek Lodge, and make sure he
is alright.
