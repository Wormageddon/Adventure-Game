Top article: 5 dogs disappeared in 1 day!
5 good dogs, one belonging to Jenna, our local beekeeper, have lost
their beloved angels last Wednesday. All 5 owners say they forgot to
bring their dogs inside the night before their disappearance. All 
5 also note that they let their dogs stay outside regularly, as they
are not the type to run away and are very friendly. If you know anything
about the location of any of these dogs, please contact their owners.
