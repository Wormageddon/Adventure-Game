My List for December 16, 19XX

Deliver the "Big Box" to Sheriff Haskell. (Big Box is in my Garage, please rm Big_Box.txt from Garage and navigate to Haskell's Office)

Check Jenna's porch for her usual package. (Maybe ask her about ordering some honey for yourself.)

Check in with Boss Matt for additional orders. (He gets his own office at the Post Office, a decorative sort to be sure.)

Take it easy!
